    Collects primary and supporting images together from a stream of mixed images.

    The basic algorithm is pretty simple:

        1. catagorize images based on the given supporting_images_map
        2. if the image type isn't already in the internal list, then add it and go back to step 1
        3. collect all images in the internal list together as a single operable
        4. clear the internal list
        5. start a new internal list with the current image
        6. return the new operable, go back to step 1

    Example usage::

        supporting_images_map = {
            ImageType.PRIMARY: lambda operable, operables: "off" not in operable.get_primary_path_nameext(),
            ImageType.NULL: lambda operable, operables: "off" in operable.get_primary_path_nameext(),
        }
