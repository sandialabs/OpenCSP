def construct_scan_given_segments_of_interest(list_of_xyz_segments, scan_parameters):
    """
    Construct a Scan object given a list of XYZ segments of interest.

    This function creates scan passes based on the provided segments and scan parameters,
    arranging them in a back-and-forth boustrophedon pattern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_of_xyz_segments : list of list of float
        A list of segments, where each segment is defined by a list of XYZ coordinates.
    scan_parameters : dict

    -------
    Scan
        A Scan object constructed from the provided segments and parameters.

    Notes

    The function assumes that the input segment list is parallel, meaning each segment points
